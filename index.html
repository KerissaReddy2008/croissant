    <p>
      A croissant (meaning crescent) is a buttery flaky viennoiserie bread roll
      named for its well known crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast - leavened dough. The dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      sheet.
